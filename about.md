I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science at California Polytechnic State University. During the school year I work part time as a software engineer, and during the summer I work full time. Through all of this, I also try and make time to continue my private coaching for competitive youth rock climbers.
I competed in rock climbing since middle school, qualifying and competing in Youth Nationals in both bouldering and sport climbing. Since then, I have tried to transition to the Collegiate and open circuit, also competing at Collegiate Nationals and participating in many North American Cup series for the open division.
