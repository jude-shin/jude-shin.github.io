## The Beginning (of the introduction to VIM)
As a computer science student, I spend a lot of time at my computer. It is true that a lot of that time is spent watching youtube, or reading some textbook for a class that I am enrolled in; hoever, a good portion of that time is also spent typing. 
One of the professors that teaches at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has been a family friend that I have known since elementary school. He happens to teach computer science, and he is one of the smartest people that I know. He is initally the one who recommended me to consider using vim, but it wasn't untill I became concerned with ergonomics that I really started to dive deeper into this rabbit bole. 
For those who don't know, Vi improved (VIM), is a progam for text editing. There are many reasons that people choose vim, and there are also a lot of good articles and documents out there that share those aspects, but in this article I want to go over the main reasons that I personally use vim. 

## Ergonomics

## Code
I should probably get some statistics on this, but when I am programming, the majoirity of the time I am not adding new characters to the file or project that I am working on. There is a good portion of my time navigating the code that I just wrote (or deleting most all of it). 
It is very rare that I sit down and write an entire program's characters, in sequence, all at once. If the majority of the time you are navigating the text in a file rather than inserting or deleting it, then why should the editors environment favor just edting?
This is why some people refer to vim's navigation as "vim motions". The default environment that the developer uses helps the navigate the documents, only allowing for the insertion of characters when needed. 



This gives a more efficient way of moving about any text editor
Console is where I live now (I will talk about linux in a different poset lined here)
{% highlight vimscript %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
