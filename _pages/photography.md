## Tools:
I found an old Cannon AE-1 Program in my mom's closet a while ago and decided to shoot some film on it. I had no idea what I was doing, and it was a miracle that I didn't ruin the film that was sitting there for 10+ years. After a few rolls where only 3 exposures could remotely be considered a photo, I started to get the hang of it.

I am still far off from calling myself a photographer, but I have a lot of fun with it; film kind of has a more permanent feel to it. Here is just a rolling gallery of all of the film that I have the time to upload.
