## Compuer Science
I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science at California Polytechnic State University. During the school year I work part time as a software engineer, and during the summer I work full time. 

## Rock Climbing
Through all of this, I also try and make time to continue my private coaching for competitive youth rock climbers. I have been rock climbing since middle school, qualifying and competing in Youth Nationals in both bouldering and sport climbing. Since then, I have transitioned to the Collegiate and Open circuit, also competing at Collegiate Nationals and participating in many North American Cup series for the open division. 

## Coaching
My love for teaching and coaching paired well with my love for climbing. I have made many mistakes while trying to navigate the competition scene, and I wanted to try and pass down the lessons I learned to others. My first climbing coaches, Will and Michelle, were phenominal; I honestly wouldn't have considered coaching if it wasn't for the amazing experience I had as their athlete. I am currently private coaching for some of the competitive youth climbers in my home gym. 

## Photography
This one is more of a small hobby, nothing as serious as my climbing or computer science life. I found an old Cannon AE-1 Program in my mom's closet and was told that my father got it for my mom when they were dating. I started taking the camera to climbing trips, parties, and other occations for fun. There is something special about not being able to see the photos unitl a few weeks after they were shot. It makes the memories a bit more special.
